Absolutely, I understand. When building for different platforms, especially MacOS and Windows, it's essential to address the specific requirements and steps involved in the process. Below is the augmented README with sections on building the program on both MacOS and Windows.

## 📥 Installation & Building the Program

### For Debian Linux:

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```sh
   git clone [URL_of_this_repository]
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Directory**
   ```sh
   cd [directory_of_cloned_repository]
   ```

3. **Compile the Program using Makefile**
   ```sh
   make
   ```

4. **Run the Program**
   ```sh
   ./Files_organizer
   ```

### For MacOS:

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```sh
   git clone [URL_of_this_repository]
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Directory**
   ```sh
   cd [directory_of_cloned_repository]
   ```

3. **Install the necessary build tools and libraries if not already present**
   ```sh
   brew install gcc make
   ```

4. **Compile the Program using Makefile**
   ```sh
   make
   ```

5. **Run the Program**
   ```sh
   ./Files_organizer
   ```

### For Windows:

This project is currently in the alpha stage, and Windows support is a part of the to-do list. However, if you want to try building it on Windows, you might want to use a C compiler like MinGW and a build system like GNU Make. Installing and using Cygwin can also provide a Unix-like environment to build and run the project.

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```sh
   git clone [URL_of_this_repository]
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Directory**
   ```sh
   cd [directory_of_cloned_repository]
   ```

3. **Install necessary tools like MinGW and Make (if not already present)**
   ```sh
   # Follow installation instructions for your specific environment.
   ```

4. **Compile the Program using Makefile**
   ```sh
   make
   ```

5. **Run the Program**
   ```sh
   ./Files_organizer.exe
   ```
